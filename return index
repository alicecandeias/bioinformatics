#just a simple function that returns the index of the character you wanna find within a string

>>> def index(seq,carac):
  i = 0
  lenght = len(seq)
  position = 0
  while i < lenght:
    if seq[i] == carac:
      return i
    else:
      position = 0
      i += 1
  return position

>>> string = 'QWERTYUIOPLKJHGFDSAZXCVBNM'
>>> c = 'V'
>>> index(string, c)
22

#you can use a python battery included that easily do the same trick, I wrote the code as an exercise because it might come in handy when doing gene location
>>> string.find('V')
22
